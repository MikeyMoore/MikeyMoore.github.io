		<h1>The Code of the Grey Jedi</h1>
		<p>This site is dedicated to the grey Jedi.  Many consider the grey Jedi to have abandoned the ways of the Jedi and gone down the path towards the dark side, even going as far as to call them "Dark Jedi".  Others would say they do not deserve the title "Jedi" at all.  While that may be the case, we believe that the code of the Grey Jedi is one that deserves a voice and should not be viewed as evil or sinister in nature.  Instead, set aside all prejudice and assumptions for now while you learn the code of the grey Jedi.  Perhaps you, like us, will find <strong>balance</strong> here.</p>

		<h2>First, a bit of clarification</h2>
		<p>Let's take a moment to focus on different force users.  The most easily recognizable would be:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Jedi</li>
			<li>Sith</li>
			<li>Force Sensitives</li>
			<li>Animals such as: Ysalamir, Toazin, Vornskr...*</li>
		</ul>
		<p style="color:orange;">*For more on force-sensitive creatures, click <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Force-sensitive_creatures">here.</a></p>
		<p>There are, of course, more unlisted here, but these tend to be the most widely recognized.</p>

		<p>The Jedi and the Sith both have a very rigid code that calls for the quelling of one idea over the cultivation of another.  They repress, or deny the existence of, a virtue/state-of-being, a strive for a purity (be it a pureness of "light side" or "dark side").</p>

		<p>This leaves no room for balance!  The original Jedi code, though it could be interpreted to mean essentially the same as the current version, seems to tip more on the balanced side (more towards the 'grey')...</p>

		<p>A lightsaber <i>should not be used in war or to seek out/exert power.  They are a symbol of peace and to be used in a non-lethal manner for self-defense.</i>  It is very interesting that both the Jedi and the Sith have taken up arms as warriors.  A Grey Jedi should not be a warrior, but a servant of the force.</p>
